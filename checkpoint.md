# Project Checkpoint Log

Rules:
1. Always follow this format per update:
   - [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ] Brief summary for each entry
2. After each task is completed, update the checkpoint file.
3. Try to ensure checkpoint file is read at the beginning of each chat session.
4. Always append - never over write the file.
